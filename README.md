## üß∞ Usage
Once you have downloaded and set up `docproc`, you can start using it for various document processing tasks. Below is a simple example to get you started:

```python
import docproc

# Load a document for analysis
document = docproc.load_document("example.pdf")

# Extract text content
text_content = docproc.extract_text(document)

# Analyze layout and regions
regions = docproc.analyze_layout(document)

# Perform text classification
text_classes = docproc.classify_text(regions)

# Extract equations from the document
equations = docproc.extract_equations(document)
```
